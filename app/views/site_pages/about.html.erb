    <h3>What's this all about?</h3>
    <p>This is who we are. So many different faces make up this active, brilliant, and (surprisingly) small community. <%= @site_title %> is a proud announcement of membership in that community.</p>
    
    <p>It also helps us all stay connected:</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="large-6 columns">
        <h4 class="title-bg">Building Relationships</h4>
        <p>Browse <%= @site_title %> on Monday. Three days later, you run into someone you found interesting and say "Hello". Coffee happens. Project happens. Magic!</p>

      <div class="large-6 columns">
        <h4>Ambient Familiarity&trade;</h4>
        <p>So you're out and about, and you see someone you recognize. Can't place the name? It happens to all of us. Next time, skim <%= @site_title %> and strike up a conversation.</p>
